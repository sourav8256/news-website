On top of these two major works, Netflix is currently producing a live-action adaptation, with the Shonen creator overlooking the series. While the Straw Hat Pirates who appeared in the earliest arcs of the Shonen series have been cast, it would seem that the series will feature some major flashbacks as a young actor has been cast for Luffy in his childhood years.One Piece wasn\'t shy about giving us looks into Luffy\'s childhood, with the flashbacks normally focusing on the formation of his dream to become the king of the pirates while also interacting with his mentor, Shanks. In the earliest installments of the series, we see Monkey D. Luffy accidentally eating his legendary Devil Fruit, granting him his trademark rubber powers while also making it impossible for him to stay afloat in the oceans that he was seeking to travel. On the anime front, promotional material for One Piece: Red has given fans a glimpse of flashbacks that will take place in the fifteenth movie of the franchise, as Luffy appears to have a history with the new character Uta, billed as the ultimate diva.The Official Twitter Account for Netflix\'s One Piece revealed that young actor Colton Osorio would be joining the cast as the young version of the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, with the new addition to the series more than likely set to share plenty of scenes with the man portraying Red-Haired Shanks, Peter Gadiot: Anchors away @coltonosorio ? pic.twitter.com\/QnhvB5gMOS-- ONE PIECE(?????)

The clown who\'s arguably the most recognizable of DC\'s villains could\'ve easily been hiddedn away from the previews to keep his appearance in Gotham Knights a surprise, but it appears that\'s not the case here following a confirmation from the game\'s creators that Joker isn\'t in Gotham Knights at all.News of the Joker\'s absence in Gotham Knights came from the San Diego Comic-Con panel for the game where creative director Patrick Redding addressed the topic during a fan Q&A (via IGN). When asked if we\'d see the Joker in the game, Redding responded by confirming that Joker wouldn\'t be present in Gotham Knights. There is hope for a character related to the Joker to be in Gotham Knights, however. While confirming that Joker wouldn\'t be in the game, Redding added \\\"I will not confirm or deny whether Harley is.\\\" If he\'s willing to say definitively that Joker is absent but plays coy about Harley Quinn, that\'s a pretty safe bet to assume that the Joker\'s companion will be present in Gotham Knights.Based on the premise of the game and what we know about it so far, it somewhat makes sense that the Joker wouldn\'t be in the game. While Batman has no shortage of villains to contend with, the Joker is the one villain most commonly associated with the hero. Redding also confirmed during the same panel that Batman was really and truly dead in Gotham Knights just as the game\'s story setup suggested, so if Batman is gone, it reasons that his primary antagonist might be sitting this one out, too.How that\'ll be explained in the narrative remains to be seen, but the game\'s already looking pretty crowded with other villains anyway. There\'s the mysterious Court of Owls, for one, and the creators already revealed that the Penguin and Mr. Freeze would be in the game, too.{replyCount}commentsGotham Knights releases on October 25th, so we\'ll see just how many different villains are in the game then when it\'s available.\",\"pubDate\":\"2022-07-23 15:35:00\",\"image_url\":\"https:\/\/sportshub.cbsistatic.com\/i\/2022\/07\/23\/4d8a88a9-f00b-4ce7-8df9-48d4f06bd58a\/gotham-knights-joker.png\",\"source_id\":\"comicbook\",\"country\":[\"united states of america\"],\"category\":[\"entertainment\"],\"language\":\"english\"},{\"title\":\"WHO triggers highest alert on monkey pox\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.malaymail.com\/news\/world\/2022\/07\/23\/who-triggers-highest-alert-on-monkey-pox\/19025\",\"keywords\":[\"WHO\",\"monkeypox\"],\"creator\":null,\"video_url\":null,\"description\":\"GENEVA, July 23 \u2015 The World Health Organization on Saturday declared the monkeypox outbreak, which has affected nearly 1...\",\"content\":\"GENEVA, July 23 \u2015 The World Health Organization on Saturday declared the monkeypox outbreak, which has affected nearly 16,000 people in 72 countries, to be a global health emergency \u2015 the highest alarm it can sound. \u201CI have decided that the global #monkeypox outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern,\u201D WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference. He said a committee of experts who met on Thursday was unable to reach a consensus, so it fell on him to decide whether to trigger the highest alert possible. \u201CWHO\u2019s assessment is that the risk of monkeypox is moderate globally and in all regions, except in the European region where we assess the risk as high,\u201D he added. Monkeypox has affected over 15,800 people in 72 countries, according to a tally by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published on July 20. A surge in monkeypox infections has been reported since early May outside the West and Central African countries where the disease has long been endemic. On June 23, the WHO convened an emergency committee (EC) of experts to decide if monkeypox constitutes a so-called Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) \u2015 the UN health agency\u2019s highest alert level. But a majority advised Tedros that the situation, at that point, had not met the threshold. The second meeting was called on Thursday with case numbers rising further, where Tedros said he was worried. \u201CI need your advice in assessing the immediate and mid-term public health implications,\u201D Tedros told the meeting, which lasted more than six hours. A US health expert sounded a grim warning late on Friday. \u201CSince the last #monkeypox EC just weeks ago, we\u2019ve seen an exponential rise in cases. It\u2019s inevitable that cases will dramatically rise in the coming weeks & months. That\u2019s why @DrTedros must sound the global alarm,\u201D Lawrence Gostin, the director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law, said on Twitter. \u201CA failure to act will have grave consequences for global health.\u201D Warning Against Discrimination A viral infection resembling smallpox and first detected in humans in 1970, monkeypox is less dangerous and contagious than smallpox, which was eradicated in 1980. Ninety-five per cent of cases have been transmitted through sexual activity, according to a study of 528 people in 16 countries published in the New England Journal of Medicine \u2015 the largest research to date. Overall, 98 per cent of infected people were gay or bisexual men, and around a third were known to have visited sex-on-site venues such as sex parties or saunas within the previous month. \u201CThis transmission pattern represents both an opportunity to implement targeted public health interventions, and a challenge because in some countries, the communities affected face life-threatening discrimination,\u201D Tedros said earlier, citing concern that stigma and scapegoating could make the outbreak harder to track. The European Union\u2019s drug watchdog on Friday recommended for approval the use of Imvanex, a smallpox vaccine, to treat monkeypox. Imvanex, developed by Danish drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, has been approved in the EU since 2013 for the prevention of smallpox. It was also considered a potential vaccine for monkeypox because of the similarity between the monkeypox virus and the smallpox virus. The first symptoms of monkeypox are fever, headaches, muscle pain and back pain during the course of five days. Rashes subsequently appear on the face, the palms of hands and soles of feet, followed by lesions, spots and finally scabs. \u2015 AFP\",\"pubDate\":\"2022-07-23 15:34:12\",\"image_url\":null,\"source_id\":\"malaymail\",\"country\":[\"singapore\",\"malaysia\"],\"category\":[\"world\"],\"language\":\"english\"},{\"title\":\"Princess Diana Would Be \u2018Thrilled to Pieces\u2019 to See How Her Sons Turned Out, Says Royal Expert \u2013 Despite the Family Feud\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.cheatsheet.com\/entertainment\/princess-diana-thrilled-pieces-see-sons-turned-says-royal-expert-family-feud.html\/\",\"keywords\":[\"Celebrity\",\"Entertainment\",\"Prince Harry\",\"Prince William\",\"Princess Diana\"],\"creator\":[\"Grace Turney\"],\"video_url\":null,\"description\":\"According to a royal expert, the late Princess Diana would be \u201Cthrilled\u201D to see how her sons, Prince Harry and Prince William, turned out.\",\"content\":\"It\u2019s hard to imagine how Princess Diana would feel about the royal family today, but according to one royal expert, she would be \u201Cthrilled\u201D by how Prince Harry and Prince William turned out. Here are the details of the rumored rift between the brothers, and what the expert said Princess Diana would think of her sons now. (L-R) Princess Diana, Prince William, and Prince Harry | Tim Graham Photo Library\/Getty Images There have been rumors of a rift between Prince Harry and Prince William For years, there have been rumors of a rift between Prince Harry and his brother, Prince William. At first, fans thought that a disagreement between Willam\u2019s wife, Kate Middleton, and Harry\u2019s spouse, Meghan Markle, created tension within the royal family. But veteran royal reporter Katie Nicholl revealed that it was actually the brothers who struggled to get along.  Nicholl\u2019s sources claimed that Harry and William had a falling out around Christmas 2018, when the Duke of Sussex confronted William about the way he treated Meghan. According to Nicholl\u2019s source (via Cosmopolitan), \u201CHarry felt William wasn\u2019t rolling out the red carpet for Meghan and told him so.\u201D The source said the brothers \u201Chad a bit of a fallout, which was only resolved when Charles stepped in and asked William to make an effort.\u201D But ultimately, Harry and Meghan ended up leaving the U.K. and relocating to the U.S. In 2021, the Duke told Oprah (via Marie Claire) that, although the \u201CU.K. is home,\u201D he had to leave due to a \u201Clack of support and lack of understanding\u201D from the royal family. Harry and Meghan recently returned to the U.K. with their two children, Archie and Lilibet, to celebrate Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Platinum Jubilee. It was the couple\u2019s first public appearance there since 2019, and many took it as a sign that relationships within the family were healing. It\u2019s hard to imagine what Princess Diana would have thought about her sons amid their rift, but one royal expert has a guess.

He also worked at Kensington Palace, where he cooked for Princess Diana and her sons, William and Harry, for years before she died in 1997. Speaking on behalf of Coffee Friend, McGrady offered his opinion on what Diana would think about Harry and William today. \u201CWilliam has always known that he\u2019s going to be King one day over Harry, William was the heir, Harry was the spare,\u201D the former royal chef said. \u201CPrincess Diana would have been thrilled to pieces now that both boys are happy, they\u2019ve found a partner and they\u2019re happy within their relationships because obviously she wasn\u2019t and went through a divorce and separation. And, of course, the children, the families that both have produced. \u201C Say what you want about the royal family, but I think we are very lucky to have William and Harry.

The Duke of Sussex spoke of when Princess Diana met Mandela. \u201COn my wall, and in my heart every day, is an image of my mother and Mandela meeting in Cape Town in 1997,\u201D Harry said (via USA Today). He shared that the photograph was given to him and Meghan Markle by the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu during the royal couple\u2019s visit to South Africa in 2019. \u201CWhen I first looked at the photo, straight away what jumped out was the joy on my mother\u2019s face,\u201D Harry said. \u201CThe playfulness, cheekiness, even.

This latest generation is good enough that I felt it could be my daily driver, the port swap system is simple enough for a child to use, and if you don\u2019t mind continuing to take part in the company\u2019s ecosystem, you\u2019ve got upgrades for years without having to throw away any more than the bare minimum. If you\u2019re not familiar with Framework, the company makes laptops and parts with two goals in mind: sustainability and repairability. The repairability piece is a breath of fresh air to someone like me who has used exclusively Apple laptops for the last 10 years \u2014 good devices to be sure, but forget about repairing or upgrading them. Framework\u2019s models are built from the ground up to be fixed, whether that\u2019s swapping out bad RAM, replacing the keyboard, or adding a (new or old) port. That feeds into the sustainability side, since instead of buying a whole new laptop every few years, you keep the old one and just swap out the piece that needs to go. Less e-waste, less cash waste. The latest Framework laptop includes the following standard: 13.5\u2033 2256\u00D71504 display (3:2 ratio) 55 Wh battery 1080p webcam Fingerprint reader 1.3 kg, 16mm thick 3.5mm headphone port You can specify storage, RAM, and of course processor, from a i5-1240P to a i7-1280P, with onboard graphics. Out of the box, the laptop is quite ordinary looking \u2014 which is a compliment, I feel. The soft grey brushed aluminum (50% recycled) and gear logo are tasteful, and the general shape is inoffensive and familiar, though it lacks the \u201Cpremium\u201D feel of a MacBook Pro (much of which comes from the MBP\u2019s unibody construction that precludes easy repair). Open it up and you have the now-familiar black bezel and black keys on silver, the now default style for mid- and high-end laptops. But you notice right away that above the screen there are little switches next to the camera and microphone. These privacy switches completely remove the device from your system\u2019s awareness \u2014 they\u2019re not just covers. It\u2019s the kind of kill switch I\u2019ve always wanted in my devices, and here it is implemented very well. Image Credits: Framework Switching them on and off actually deregisters them in the OS (in my case, Windows 11), and they pop back up as soon as you click them back on. It\u2019s just like plugging and unplugging a USB peripheral (which is probably more or less how it works inside the box). My only caveat is the switch is a little difficult to snick back and forth, which is probably for the best since it would be annoying to be hitting it on accident all the time. The rest of the basic laptop items are as expected: the screen is fine, if a rather unusual resolution, and the whole bezel can be swapped out for different colors if you want to fly your freak flag (or just an orange one). The fingerprint reader, which doubles as a power button, worked flawlessly for me. Image Credits: Framework The keyboard is advertised as having a longer travel distance (1.5mm) than others, and that does feel true, though it\u2019s still a long way from having the tactility of a mechanical or anything like that. It\u2019s a perfectly good laptop keyboard and if you tend to bottom out when you type on shallower ones, this could be a nice upgrade. I only had one serious hardware problem and that was the power cord. It\u2019s stiff, ugly, and bulky. I would happily sacrifice a port for a custom magnetic power connector or pay extra for a Hot swappable and cold fixable The Framework laptop open to the elements. It\u2019s actually upside-down right now, something I realized after I took the picture. Image Credits: Devin Coldewey \/ TechCrunch Where the Framework diverges from the rest is in its hot swappable side ports. When you order the laptop, you also order as many ports as you need, from USB-C to USB-A, Micro SD, Ethernet, HDMI, and removable storage up to a terabyte. The only port the laptop is born with is a 3.5mm headphone adapter. Image Credits: Framework The little port devices are essentially self-contained USB-C adapters, so they don\u2019t register as extra devices or anything like that (except that they\u2019ll mount as drives in the case of an inserted card or drive, of course). They lock into place quite securely \u2014 you may feel too securely, but how often do you need to change them out? As someone who refused to upgrade my Mac for years because of their port shenanigans, this feels like the best of both worlds. I can plug in the power on the right or left, swap in the Micro SD when I\u2019m doing that sort of thing, and keep the HDMI in for just in case. The flexibility is nice to have, though I would have liked a full size SD one for camera work. Hopefully more are on the way, but they\u2019ve covered the main use cases and of course my existing adapters still work. When it comes to the internals, it\u2019s a bit different from the usual DIY computing style. When I put together a desktop, I buy an ATX standard motherboard and pick my components from a range of compatible pieces. Non-standard parts tend to be motherboard-specific or for things like dual-GPU setups or liquid cooling. With the Framework, there\u2019s a mix of standard parts (the internal SSD, for instance) and device-specific ones, like the mainboard and audio module. So if you intend to make this laptop your main for the next five years or so, you have to be OK with the idea of Framework being your primary supplier. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing \u2014 but some people do value being able to just order a part and swap it in. The truth is, though, that although the old method of building and maintaining a DIY computer are not completely here, the spirit certainly is. You may not be able to choose between MSI, Asus, and Gigabyte for some parts, but you can still easily replace them, even tweak them to your liking. I think this allows for a happy medium between the fully DIY but buggy and chunky laptops that hardware enthusiasts tend to be stuck with and the sleeker, but barely upgradeable ones that the majority end up with. Framework isn\u2019t necessarily trying to get people already wild for DIY to go upscale \u2014 this is about capturing people who\u2019d like a little more flexibility and reusability but can\u2019t find it in mainstream devices. QR code links point you to replacements, instructions, and other info. Image Credits: Devin Coldewey \/ TechCrunch From my limited delvings into the internals, I think that anyone comfortable enough to open it will also be fine switching out a piece. It really is close to drop-in and there are instructions baked into the parts, easy enough to look up and follow. All it takes is the included screwdriver, which is also helpfully magnetic: Looks big but isn\u2019t big. Image Credits: Devin Coldewey \/ TechCrunch I\u2019ve always shied away from PC laptops because the truth is Apple\u2019s products are in many ways built to last \u2014 my old 2012 Air is now running Zorin and loving life. I\u2019m not sure I could do that if I had a 2012 Acer (though as usual, it\u2019s not the years, it\u2019s the mileage). But the Framework suggests to me that there\u2019s a real reason to switch to their approach (though it sure isn\u2019t Windows 11, which the review device shipped with, though you can select others). Attempting to be a little more ethical about gadget buying is a good thing, but I also just like the idea of buying something that will actually last 5-10 years, and not just become more and more obsolete. At $819 for the lowest configuration, it\u2019s not the cheapest laptop on the market, and you could almost certainly find one with better specs for a similar price if you looked. But if you think about that money (and another $50-100 for ports, etc) as the beginning of an investment, and one that will prevent you from having to buy another computer 3-4 years from now, it starts to make more sense. Plus you\u2019re supporting a company that\u2019s doing more than talk in service of the right to repair and reducing e-waste. If I was in the market for a non-Mac laptop, Framework would be my first stop. I hope that in the future they\u2019ll offer more models, and other options for customization to lower the cost or accommodate specialty builds.\",\"pubDate\":\"2022-07-23 15:31:52\",\"image_url\":null,\"source_id\":\"techcrunch\",\"country\":[\"united states of america\"],\"category\":[\"health\"],\"language\":\"english\"},{\"title\":\"GoM visits Bangalore Turf Club, gets apprised on aspects of horse racing\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/sport\/races\/gom-visits-bangalore-turf-club-gets-apprised-on-aspects-of-horse-racing\/article65675479.ece\",\"keywords\":null,\"creator\":[\"\\n        Sports Bureau  \\n    \"],\"video_url\":null,\"description\":\"The group gathers first-hand information on horse racing and functioning of the club with specific reference to totalizator operations\",\"content\":null,\"pubDate\":\"2022-07-23 15:31:49\",\"image_url\":null,\"source_id\":\"thehindu\",\"country\":[\"india\"],\"category\":[\"sports\"],\"language\":\"english\"}],\"nextPage\":1}';
